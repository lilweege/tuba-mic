# tuba-mic
A program that will reduce microphone gain within windows if it is peaking

### why
my brother [Umberto](https://umberto.quattrociocchi.net) teaches tuba lessons over the internet. The problem he faces is that he can't set a single mic gain level such that the tuba doesn't peak and his speaking isn't too quiet. I decided why not try to fix this.

### why not
as is turns out, there is a nearly unavoidable problem. The program cannot pick up the first instant of his playing fast enough, which results in a short loud blip. I may revisit this project later if I can figure this out.
